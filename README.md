## Abstract
This research presents a novel operating system architecture that embeds blockchain at the kernel level for enabling transparent and immutable logging of artificial intelligence (AI) decisions. The work addresses the urgent need for accountability of AI in operating systems (OS) by introducing tamper-evident blockchain ledgers that track AI operations. Through empirical analyses of transaction-processing times, storage requirements, and security effectiveness, this research demonstrates that tamper detection can be optimally performed using blockchain integration while maintaining feasible performance parameters for practical deployment.

## Key Findings
- Achieved 57 seconds median transaction processing time
- Implemented 95% storage efficiency through optimized blocks
- Demonstrated 100% tamper detection accuracy
- Maintained minimal footprint of 150 bytes per decision record
- Validated enterprise-level scalability supporting 10,000 daily AI decisions
